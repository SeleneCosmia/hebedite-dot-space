    <div><p>Aug 24, 2023:</p><p>Hi there... it's been a while now since my last update huh? Well, I've learned a lot more about programming in general since my last update, and I've also switched to linux from microsoft in that time. So I've decided to do a complete overhaul of my site, because, as it stands now, my website is bloated and generally not how I would like it to be. I already updated to a personal domain name, and will be continually updated and deleting my older code. I can't wait to show you all what this website's future will be, and thanks for stopping by if you're currently reading this</p></div>
    <div><p>Jan 05, 2023:</p><p>Completed the Pokemon top tens lists, still need to fix a few things there in the coming days.</p></div>
    <div><p>Jan 04, 2023:</p><p>Overhauled the nav bar to make the links actual buttons, and disabled access to the placeholder tabs. Updated the updates box's CSS. Re-categorized the legendaries list in my top tens list on the Pokemon page.</p></div>
    <div><p>Jan 03, 2023:</p><p>Added the updates column to the home page and exstensively redesigned the Pokemon page. Added more Pokemon and categories to the Top Tens column.</p></div>
